# Secure FOSS

This organisation is my attempt to organise and keep track of the open-source tools I use. The goal is to explore ways to improve security, reduce supply-chain risks, and better understand how these tools work. Nothing here is official or guaranteed — it's mainly a personal learning and experimentation space.
